The following excerpt is the introducory paragraph of How Chinese Officials Use the Internet to
Construct their Public Image. [@pan] 

Over the past decade, China has launched a number of online government transparency
policy initiatives aimed at improving publicly available information concerning the activities
of lower-tier officials. These initiatives have been praised as innovations that leverage
the power of the Internet to improve governance and transparency [@horsley; @jiang; @un]. Senior leaders within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and government regulations have described these efforts as ways to ensure “hard-working and honest government.” [@seifert]

# Overview

The paper analyses how local government officials use the websites they are required to put up to meet the central government’s transparency requirements, to engineer their public image. It concludes that the internet becomes a tool for self-promotion in authoritarian regimes. The analysis demonstrates that the websites tend to highlight the competence (achievements) or the benevolence (concern for citizens) of these county executives which changes based on the tenure of their cycle. The former is more important to officials that are later in their cycle, while the latter is more important to those earlier in the cycle.

The analysis does so by focusing on a random sample of 100 Chinese counties and their websites. They represent 29 Chinese provinces. Based on this sample they estimate the proportion of posts for competence and benevolence by year in office, where group refers to the year, with 95% confidence intervals in lwr and upr. Generated using Hopkins and King (2010) ReadMe software. The authors then conduct a linear regression that regresses a mayor first year or last year binary indicator on  the number of competence metnions on the websites by county which they extend gradually for additional variables in alternative models. The same is then done for benevolence. These variable include: county resources and environmental factors, incentives of county party secretaries, incentives of prefecture party secretary and other prefecture-level characteristics, county executive’s ability, age, and gender, post-treatment variable of whether the county executive was promoted. The authors conclude from the regression that When a county executive is in the last year of office, an additional 15% or so of website content is on average dedicated to claims of competence. Similarly they conclude that When a county executive is in the first year of office, an additional 10% to 15% of website content is on average dedicated to claims of benevolence. Both results are statistically significant at the 0.05 level.
