# Gov_1006_final_project

# This is the final project for our Gov 1006 class. The task is to reproduce an academic paper, leveraging  the data and the code that was published with it. I have decided to focus on the research paper: "How Chinese Officials Use the Internet to Construct their Public Image" by Jennifer Pany, published in June 15, 2017.
